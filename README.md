# Mayhaps [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mayhaps.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mayhaps)

Mayhaps (maybe) call Ruby methods.

## Usage

Mayhaps allows you to call methods on objects that may or may not be
nil.

First, install the gem or add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "mayhaps", "~> 0.1.0"
```

Next, require it:

```ruby
require 'mayhaps'
```

### On the surface

Mayhaps adds a `maybe` method to all objects that allows you to call
methods on the object regardless of whether or not it is nil. It does
this by wrapping the object in a `Maybe` object, more specifically a
`Nothing` object for nil or a `Just` object for anything else. In order
to unwrap the value, use unary `+` on the `Maybe` object.

#### Examples

```ruby
hash = {:foo => " foo "}

hash[:foo].maybe.upcase #=> #<Just " FOO ">
hash[:bar].maybe.upcase #=> #<Nothing>

+hash[:foo].maybe.upcase #=> " FOO "
+hash[:bar].maybe.upcase #=> nil

+hash[:foo].maybe.upcase.strip #=> "FOO"
+hash[:bar].maybe.upcase.strip #=> nil
```

```ruby
# Without Mayhaps
if customer && customer.order && customer.order.id == some_id
  # Do something with customer
end

# With Mayhaps
require 'mayhaps'

if +customer.maybe.order.id == some_id
  # Do something with customer
end
```

### The nitty gritty

`Just` and `Nothing` both inherit from `BasicObject` rather than
`Object` in order to allow the maximum number of methods to fall through
to the wrapped object. This includes methods like `class` and `is_a?`,
therefore the `===` method of the `Maybe` classes should be used to
check if an object is wrapped in a `Maybe`.

```ruby
Maybe === :a.maybe #=> true
Just === :a.maybe #=> true
Maybe === nil.maybe #=> true
Nothing === nil.maybe #=> true
```

The methods that will be called on the `Maybe` object itself and not the
wrapped object are as follows:

* `+@`
* `method_missing`
* `inspect`
* `maybe`
* `_dump`
* `==`
* `equal?`
* `!`
* `!=`
* `instance_eval`
* `instance_exec`
* `__send__`
* `__id__`

`_dump` is a method added by the `Singleton` module, which `Nothing`
includes.

The `maybe` method defined on `Maybe` objects simply returns `self`.

The `maybe` method should be used to wrap objects in `Maybe` objects,
but they can also be created directly. Since `Nothing` is a `Singleton`,
its instance can be accessed using `Nothing.instance`. A `Just` object
can be created by calling `Just.new`. If the object passed to `Just.new`
is `nil`, an ArgumentError will be raised.
