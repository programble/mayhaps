# Mayhaps

Mayhaps call Ruby methods.

## Usage

Mayhaps allows you to call methods on objects that may or may not be
nil.

First, install the gem or add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "mayhaps", "~> 0.1.0"
```

Next, require it. There are two choices for using Mayhaps:

1. `require 'mayhaps'`: Provides the `mayhaps` and `mayhaps_chain`
   methods.
2. `require 'mayhaps/maybe'`: Provides the `maybe` and `maybe_chain`
   methods as aliases for the above.

For the following examples, `require 'mayhaps/maybe'` is used.

### Maybe

The `maybe` method allows you to call a method on an object that may or
may not be nil. If the object is nil, then the result of calling the
method will also be nil.

```ruby
hash = {:foo => "foo"}

hash[:foo].maybe.upcase #=> "FOO"
hash[:bar].maybe.upcase #=> nil
```

### Chaining

The `maybe_chain` method works similarly, except it allows you to chain
method calls and requires you to call `end` in order to retrieve the
result, which is either the result of the chain of method calls, or nil
if any of the methods in the chain returned nil.

```ruby
hash = {:foo => " foo "}

hash[:foo].maybe_chain.strip.upcase.end #=> "FOO"
hash[:bar].maybe_chain.strip.upcase.end #=> nil
```

### Examples

```ruby
# Without Mayhaps
if customer && customer.order && customer.order.id == some_id
  # Do something with customer
end

# With Mayhaps
require 'mayhaps/maybe'

if customer.maybe_chain.order.id.end == some_id
  # Do something with customer
end
```
